# Pastel linux rice
I was inspired by [diinki retro future rice](https://github.com/diinki/diinki-retrofuture) so I made my own rice :3

This is a soft, pastel-themed desktop setup built with Sway, Waybar, Wofi, and Kitty

I found wallpaper somewhere on the internet can't find the artist for credits :(

# Install

Im using [endeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) as distro.

sudo pacman -S sway swaybg wofi waybar nemo nautilus kitty

Install [Maple Mono font](https://github.com/subframe7536/Maple-font) to `/usr/share/fonts`, then run `fc-cache -f -v`.

Clone this repo and copy all config folders into your `.config` repository then change your wallpaper path in sway config file.
